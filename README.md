# NHS-Accidents-Emergency-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes Accident & Emergency (A&E) performance data across the NHS in England from January 2021 to January 2025. The dataset, sourced from [NHS England](https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/ae-waiting-times-and-activity/), was cleaned and merged into a single table to track key performance indicators like total attendances, emergency admissions, and 4-hour wait times. The NHS standard mandates that 95% of A&E patients should be seen within 4 hours. This dashboard helps assess performance across years, trusts, and department types.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

Category 1: Total A&E Attendances

Category 2: 4-Hour Standard Compliance

Category 3: Emergency Admissions

Category 4: Provider-Level and Departmental Trends

The dataset was cleaned, aggregated, and analyzed in Power Query before being visualized in Power BI.

# Dataset Description
The data model comprises three tables capturing NHS A&E performance across time, geography, providers, and metrics, totaling 151,270 records

## Tables
* AE_Activity_Fact: Main fact table with A&E activity data (categories, timeframes, date, provider, region, value).
* DateTable: Date dimension for filtering and time analysis (date, month, quarter, year).
* Trends Selector: Helper table for trend slicers (selector name, field mapping, order).
  
### Calculated Measures
* Emergency Admission Measures: Calculated columns/measures for emergency admissions.
* DAX Measures: Pre-calculated KPIs (e.g., % Seen after 4 hours).

# Executive Summary
## Overview of Findings
Between 2021 and 2025, the NHS experienced a substantial increase in A&E attendances, but performance against the 4-hour target consistently fell short of the 95% standard. Emergency admissions rose sharply, and some providers showed significantly higher volumes and delays.

* Total A&E attendances rose from 22.8M in 2021 to 27.4M in 2024.
* Only 69.14% of patients were seen within 4 hours as of 2024, well below the 95% target.
* Emergency admissions surged to 25M from 2021 to January 2025.
* Major A&E departments are responsible for the majority of delays.
# Insights Deep Dive
## Category 1: Total A&E Attendances
* Attendance increased 20% from 22.8M in 2021 to 27.4M in 2024.
* Major trusts like Barts Health NHS Trust and Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust recorded over 2M attendances each.
* The rise in attendance reflects increased pressure on emergency services post-pandemic.

## Category 2: 4-Hour Standard Compliance
* The 4-hour performance rate dropped below 70%, far short of the 95% NHS benchmark.
* A&E departments managed to see only 69.14% of patients within 4 hours in 2024.
* Patients waiting more than 4 hours rose to over 18M annually.
* Minor Injury Units performed better, while Major A&Es saw significant backlogs.

## Category 3: Emergency Admissions
* Emergency admissions climbed from 6M in 2021 to 6.6M in 2024.
* Breakdown shows >4h and >12h delays contributing significantly to strain.
* University Hospitals Birmingham had the highest emergency admissions volume (~0.74M).

## Category 4: Provider-Level and Departmental Trends
* Top 10 providers accounted for over 15M attendances cumulatively.
* Major A&E departments showed the worst performance in meeting the 4-hour rule.
* Only 2.53% of attendances were seen in single-specialty departments within 4 hours.
* These trusts are not underperforming in the traditional sense but are operating under disproportionate pressure with limited resources.
* The gap between patients seen in <4h vs >4h widened steadily from 2021 to 2024.
* High-volume providers like Barts Health and Manchester University NHS Trust see over 2 million attendances annually, which puts immense strain on staff and physical infrastructure.
* The performance gap is systemic, rooted in national workforce shortages, seasonal surges, and post-pandemic demand increases.

# Recommendations
* Capacity-Driven Support: Instead of penalizing trusts with low 4-hour compliance, identify them as high-pressure sites and prioritize them for additional staffing, funding, and infrastructure support.
* Resource Scaling: Invest in scalable A&E surge capacity, including temporary staff pools and modular treatment spaces, particularly for trusts facing sustained high volumes.
* Workforce Strategy: Expand recruitment, retention, and upskilling initiatives to alleviate shortages in critical roles (A&E doctors, nurses, porters).
* Intelligent Triage & Flow Management: Deploy digital triage tools and discharge planning systems to reduce bottlenecks and free up beds faster.
* Public Health & Diversion Initiatives: Strengthen urgent treatment centres (UTCs) and 111 services to redirect non-critical cases before they reach A&E.

# Assumptions
* Data completeness from NHS England is assumed post-cleaning.
* All KPIs calculated based on provided categories without imputation.
* Data filtered for completeness across Jan 2021â€“Jan 2025 only.
* Departmental breakdowns used NHS classification of major/minor/specialty A&Es.
